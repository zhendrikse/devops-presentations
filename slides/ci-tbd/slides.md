### But first ...

[..] Who the f... are you?

I am Zeger Hendrikse, nice to meet you too üòâ

## CI in the context of CD

#### First question: CI practice

##### Which of the following is **not** a CI best practice?

<div class="r-stack" align="left">

<p><!-- .element class="fragment" -->
<b>A:</b> Deploy the code to a test environment<br />
<b>B:</b> Keep the build fast<br />
<b>C:</b> Everyone commits to the baseline everyday<br />
<b>D:</b> When the build fails, everybody stops and helps to fix the build<br />
</p>

<p><!-- .element class="fragment" -->
<font style="color:#FF0000; font-weight: bold">A:</font> Deploy the code to a test environment<br />
<font style="color:#00FF00; font-weight: bold">B:</font> Keep the build fast<br />
<font style="color:#00FF00; font-weight: bold">C:</font> Everyone commits to the baseline everyday<br />
<font style="color:#00FF00; font-weight: bold">D:</font> When the build fails, everybody stops and helps to fix the build<br />
</p>

</div>

#### Second question: version control

##### What is the primary purpose of a VCS?

<div class="r-stack" align="left">

<p><!-- .element class="fragment" -->
<b>A:</b> To facilitate roll backs and roll forwards<br/>
<b>B:</b> To facilitate seamless branching and merging<br/>
<b>C:</b> To facilitate communication and collaboration<br/>
<b>D:</b> To facilitate a central back-up of source code<br/>
</p>

<p><!-- .element class="fragment" -->
<font style="color:#FF0000; font-weight: bold">A:</font> To facilitate roll backs and roll forwards<br/>
<font style="color:#FF0000; font-weight: bold">B:</font> To facilitate seamless branching and merging<br/>
<font style="color:#00FF00; font-weight: bold">C:</font> To facilitate communication and collaboration<br/>
<font style="color:#FF0000; font-weight: bold">D:</font> To facilitate a central back-up of source code<br/>
</p>

</div>

#### Do you practice Continuous Integration?

</div>

#### Third question: amplify feedback loops

##### Which is the odd one out?

<div class="r-stack" align="left">

<p><!-- .element class="fragment" -->
<b>A:</b> Integrate early and often<br/>
<b>B:</b> Small batch size (containing changes)<br/>
<b>C:</b> Pair-programming<br/>
<b>D:</b> Pull requests<br/>
</p>

<p><!-- .element class="fragment" -->
<font style="color:#00FF00; font-weight: bold">A:</font> Integrate early and often<br/>
<font style="color:#00FF00; font-weight: bold">B:</font> Small batch size (containing changes)<br/>
<font style="color:#00FF00; font-weight: bold">C:</font> Pair-programming<br/>
<font style="color:#FF0000; font-weight: bold">D:</font> Pull requests<br/>

### Which branching strategy should I choose?

### So right off the bat ...

### The Big Controversy

> [...] I get ‚ÄúHeretic, burn him at the stake‚Äù kind of feedback [...] &mdash; [Dave Farley](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=247)

### What do we usually see?

### The Death 

![death](./images/hiclipart.com.png)

### of Continuous Integration

---

### Negative effects of branches

- Delays integration 
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
  - Slower feedback loops
  <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
    - Kills continuous integration
    <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- Increased change batch size
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
  - Slower feedback loops
  <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
    - Decreased deployment frequency
    <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- Kills communication 
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
  - Headphone/hero developers!
  <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

> _The trunk-based development is all about communication. We use version_
  _control to communicate what we're doing to the rest of the team. To do it_
    _regularly enough, we have to work in very small batches._ [Jez Humble](https://github.com/rht-labs/enablement-docs/issues/123)

### State of DevOps report

[![TBD](./images/organizational_performance.jpg)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines)

---

### Trunk Based Development (TBD)

### Rules for TBD
- **Small commits** (approx 10 - 15 lines)
- Commits (_self contained_ and _consistent_) include production and test code
- Always commit and push together
- **No** branches (except for spikes)
- Code commits are reviewed ([early and synchronously](http://allankelly.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/code-and-other-reviews-small-piece-of.html))

---

### TBD in action

### More objections! The usual suspects...

![Dave](./images/davefarley.jpg)

> _At one extreme I get ‚ÄúHeretic, burn him at the stake‚Äù kind of feedback, at_
  _the other ‚ÄúYes, but it can‚Äôt possibly work without Feature Branching ‚Äì you must_
    _work in small teams and/or on trivially simple projects‚Äù._ &mdash; [Dave Farley](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=247)

### I am (frequently) pulling from the mainline!

### TDB: small and frequent commits

### Low-frequency integration

Suppose S1 and V1 contain a merge conflict...
