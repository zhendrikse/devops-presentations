# Coders should test

# Testers should code

# Goals

- Coding and testing are two sides of the same coin
- Live demo of (an introduction to) TDD

---

# Rulez of the game

- Questions are allowed at all times
--

- The example is meant to illustrate _the TDD process_
--

  - The goal is **not** to write the best _Javascript_ ever!
--

  - User story is not the most realistic either
--

- Very, very, very small steps:

---

# Who is doing what

- Raise your hand if you write unit test afterwards
--

- Raise your hand if you write unit test beforehand
--

- Raise your hand if you do TDD

---

# TDD is not building a bridge nor house!

# User story

As a worker in a restaurant 

I want to place my plates on a stack 

so that I always have clean plates available to serve dishes

---

# Let's create a plan

- Start with an empty stack
- Define pop on an empty stack
- Define push on an empty stack
- Define pop on a non-empty stack
- Define multiple pushes and pops

# Let's do this

- Let's do this [in Javascript](./javascript/index.html)!
- Let's do this [in Python](./python/index.html)!
- Let's do this [in Typescript](./typescript/index.html)!
- Let's do this in Java
- Let's do this in C#
- Let's do this in C++

---

# Retrospective

- Tests become more _specific_, codes becomes more _generic_
--

- [TBD](../ci-tbd/index.html) is a no-brainer
--

- Difficulty is postponing "the gold"
--

- Contravariant test suite
--

- 1, 2, N
--

- Tests grouped according to shared set-up
--

- What is still left to test?
