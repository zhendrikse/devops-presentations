# Second question: CI practice

### Which of the following is NOT a CI best practice?

* **A**: Deploy the code to a test environment
* **B**: Keep the build fast
* **C**: Everyone commits to the baseline everyday
* **D**: When the build fails, everybody stops and helps to fix the build

# Why Use a Version Control System?

--
- Collaboration

--
- Storing multiple versions (properly)

--
- Restoring Previous Versions

--
- Understanding What Happened

--
- Backup

---

#Centralized Version Control (VCS)

![Centralized VCS](./images/version-control-fig2.png)

--

- [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System)
--

- [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System)

---

#Distributed Version Control (DVCS)

![Distributed VCS](./images/version-control-fig3.png)

--

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
--

- [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)

---

#Git is a DVCS

# Let's practice

### Scenario 1, two, and 3

- [O'reilly](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git), 
  Learn Git Version Control using Interactive Browser-Based Scenarios

---

# Git Background

- Developed by Linus Torvalds
  - Take CVS as an example of what _not_ to do; 
    if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision.
  - Support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow
  - Strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious
--

- Originally developed with open source projects in mind
--

- Often praised for its branching support

---

# Git-like systems

- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (Atlassian)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) (Microsoft)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (Originally Dutch)
- [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/)
- Etc.

---

# Resources on the Internet

- [Version control concepts and best practices](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control.html) (hard core text)
- [Interactive Git Tutorials](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/interactive-git-tutorials/) (graphical and interactive)
- [Favorite Free Courses](https://medium.com/@javinpaul/top-10-free-courses-to-learn-git-and-github-best-of-lot-967aa314ea)

# What's the fuzz about branches?

--

![Branches](./images/branches_intro.png)

---

# Git and branches

- Git has excellent support for branches
  - From then on, the world started branching...
--

- Can you think of advantages?
--

- Can you think of disadvantages?

# TDB: small and frequent commits

### Low-frequency integration

![Merging](./images/merge_1.png)

Suppose S1 and V1 contain a merge conflict...

---

# TDB: small and frequent commits

### Low-frequency integration

![Merging](./images/merge_2.png)

... merge conflicts are late and big!

---

# TDB: small and frequent commits

### High-frequency integration

![Merging](./images/merge_3.png)

Suppose S1 and V1 contain a merge conflict...

---

# TBD: small and frequent commits

### High-frequency integration

![Merging](./images/merge_4.png)

... merge conflicts are small and early!

# Trunk Based Development (TBD)

> _The trunk-based development is all about communication. We use version_
  _control to communicate what we're doing to the rest of the team. To do it_
  _regularly enough, we have to work in very small batches._

>  -[Jez Humble](https://github.com/rht-labs/enablement-docs/issues/123)

--

### Rules for TBD
- Small commits (approx 10 - 15 lines)
- Commits (_self contained_ and _consisten_) include production and test code
- Always commit and push together
- **NO** branches
- _All code pulls_ are _always_ reviewed by _all team members_
