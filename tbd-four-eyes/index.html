# CI check: why version control

### What is the primary purpose of a VCS/Git?

* **A**: To facilitate roll backs and roll forwards
* **B**: To facilitate seamless branching and merging
* **C**: To facilitate communication and collaboration
* **D**: To facilitate a central back-up of source code

# CI final check

### What does Continuous Integration mean in practice?

* **A**: Building your application and running your unit tests on a server
* **B**: Creating releasable artifacts using a CI pipeline
* **C**: Automating all aspects that are required to build your software
* **D**: Running checks locally, direct commits on trunk and subsequent automated builds

# Third question: amplify feedback loops

### Which is the odd one out?

* **A** Integrate early and often
* **B** Small batch size (containing changes)
* **C** Pair programming
* **D** Pull requests

#Negative effects of branches

- Delay integration 
  - Slower feedback loops
  - Kills _continuous_ integration
--

- Increased change batch size
  - Slower feedback loops
  - Decreased deployment frequency
--

- Kill communication 
  - Headphone/hero developers!

# Definition by Jez Humble

> ![Jez](./images/jezhumble.jpg)

> _The trunk-based development is all about communication. We use version_
  _control to communicate what we're doing to the rest of the team. To do it_
  _regularly enough, we have to work in very small batches._

>  -[Jez Humble](https://github.com/rht-labs/enablement-docs/issues/123)

# State of DevOps report

[![TBD](./images/organizational_performance.jpg)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines)

---

# Trunk Based Development (TBD)

### Rules for TBD
- **Small commits** (approx 10 - 15 lines)
- Commits (_self contained_ and _consistent_) include production and test code
- Always commit and push together
- **No** branches (except for spikes)
- _All code commits_ are reviewed ([early and synchronously](http://allankelly.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/code-and-other-reviews-small-piece-of.html))

#FEP: Segregation of Duties (SoD)

![WC eend](./images/wc-eend.png)

--

- Finance: mortgage requestor approves his own mortgage request 
--

- IT: developer writes and tests his own code
--

- [Etc.](https://simplicable.com/new/four-eyes-principle)

---

# SoD at financial institutions
No one should be able to push his code and tests single-handedly to PRD

# But really...

_Somewhere_ an independent (automated!) approval should happen:

![Pipeline](./images/ci-cd-pipelines.png)

What did ABN-AMRO choose?

---

# Automated registration of changes in Snow

- Minor and path versions are _pre_ approved
- Major versions require manual approvals (still)

---

# But I need my code reviews!

![Code review](./images/code_review.jpg)
... but do you **really** do?

---

# But I need proof too!

- Eventually it boils down to trust
  - PRs are often superficially reviewed
  - TBD should involve _all_ team members
--

- We may need to educate the auditors
  - No more (additional) manual steps
  - Convince of a modern way to assert SoD
