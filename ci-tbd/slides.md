#### First question: CI practice

### Which of the following is **not** a CI best practice?

* **A**: Deploy the code to a test environment
* **B**: Keep the build fast
* **C**: Everyone commits to the baseline everyday
* **D**: When the build fails, everybody stops and helps to fix the build

### The Big Controversy

### What do we usually see?

### The Death 

![death](./images/hiclipart.com.png)

### of Continuous Integration

### Negative effects of branches

- Delays integration 
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
  - Slower feedback loops
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
  - Kills continuous integration
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- Increased change batch size
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
  - Slower feedback loops
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
  - Decreased deployment frequency
<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- Kills communication

> _The trunk-based development is all about communication. We use version_
  _control to communicate what we're doing to the rest of the team. To do it_
  _regularly enough, we have to work in very small batches._ [Jez Humble](https://github.com/rht-labs/enablement-docs/issues/123)

### State of DevOps report

[![TBD](./images/organizational_performance.jpg)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines)

---

### Trunk Based Development (TBD)

### Rules for TBD
- **Small commits** (approx 10 - 15 lines)
- Commits (_self contained_ and _consistent_) include production and test code
- Always commit and push together
- **No** branches (except for spikes)
- Code commits are reviewed ([early and synchronously](http://allankelly.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/code-and-other-reviews-small-piece-of.html))

### TBD in action

### More objections! The usual suspects...

![Dave](./images/davefarley.jpg)

> _At one extreme I get ‚ÄúHeretic, burn him at the stake‚Äù kind of feedback, at_
  _the other ‚ÄúYes, but it can‚Äôt possibly work without Feature Branching ‚Äì you must_
  _work in small teams and/or on trivially simple projects‚Äù._ &mdash; [Dave Farley](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=247)

### I am (frequently) pulling from the mainline!

### TDB: small and frequent commits

### Low-frequency integration

Suppose S1 and V1 contain a merge conflict...
